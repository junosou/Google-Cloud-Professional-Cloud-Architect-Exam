This is not a technical training course
Don't expect to be taught the touchstone concepts here. The purpose of them in this course is to help you evaluate your preparedness. Seek training in the technical training courses, documentation, labs, and so forth.

Practice the case evaluation method on cases and on sample questions

Proposed Solution
This is not just a test-taking skill. This is a skill used in practice by consultants on the job. It is how they think about their customer engagements and talk about it with other professionals.

What questions would you want to ask a client?
You can make reasonable assumptions about a case. But if you seem to be missing information, especially technical information, that may be useful. It may help constrain the degree of freedom and limit the number of potentially correct answers. It might indicate that an answer is incorrect. In other words, use what you don't know or what is missing in the case to help you evaluate the intent of the question.

Make sure you know what is being asked.
If you find yourself speculating and trying to add information to the case beyond reasonable assumptions, then you might be drifting off of the intent of the question.

Hands-on
It is a good idea to review and run through basic labs so that the hands-on details are fresh in mind. You might want to review steps of labs you performed before. Or you might want to do some of them again.

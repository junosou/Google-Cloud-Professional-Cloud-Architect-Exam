Read through the exam guide outline.

The outline communicates how an authority thinks about and organizes the skills required of a Professional Cloud Architect.

Training tends to be organized in a ramp; basic concepts first, building into more complex and difficult concepts later. The Exam Guide is not training. So it is not organized for learning, or by importance, or by process. It is organized according to how a group of experts thinks about the job.

There is no additional information about what any particular line means; no explanation.

Use the Exam Guide outline to help identify what to study.
The recommendation is for you to read through each line and think about what it actually means, what do you think it is saying about the job? Then ask yourself if you understand that aspect of the job and if you feel you have the skills required to be successful in that part of the job. If yes -- great. It is an indicator that you are prepared. If no -- take note. You may want to study additionally in that part or develop specific skills for that item in the Exam Guide.
